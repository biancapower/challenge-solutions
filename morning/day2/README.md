# Multiply and Add

Create two seperate functions. Both functions will take two arguments.

One function will add these two numbers together and return the result.

The other function will multiply these two numbers and return the result.

E.g. add(5, 7), should return 12

E.g. add(5, -7), should return -2

E.g. multiply(5, 7), should return 35

E.g. multiply(5, -7), should return -35
